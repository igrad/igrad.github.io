Hi, I'm Ian. I'm a software engineer with a passion for good design 
practice, intuitive UX, and strategic organization. I'm a native 
Iowan, University of Iowa grad (class of 2019), and currently a 
Software Engineer with RFA Engineering contracted to John Deere 
Intelligent Solutions Group.

<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>This page is a small hub for everything you need to know about me, but 
    if you have any questions (professional or otherwise), feel free to 
    send me an email at 
    <a href="mailto:iangradert@gmail.com">iangradert@gmail.com</a>.</p>
    
<p>Outside of software development, I'm a huge fan of video games, music, 
    cinema, and table-top games. In fact, I have video games to thank for 
    introducing me to programming in the first place, way back when Call 
    of Duty 2 was popular in the mid 2000's. I became 
    recognizable in the modding scene for a few games before college, 
    where a more serious introduction to programming spurred my interest. 
    Since then, we've learned that C probably isn't the easiest first 
    programming language to learn. Now, I'm serviceable in a half-dozen 
    languages and frameworks, and I'm even proficient in a few - namely 
    C++ and Python. I'm still growing as a software developer - learning 
    new tricks, refining my style, and adopting new practices.</p>
    
<p>I currently have one project in active development, and several others 
    on the sketchboard, along with a plethora of other ideas that will 
    likely never come to fruition. The current project is a cross-platform
    note-taking application built on C++14 and Qt. It's a newer form of  
    note-taking application, dubbed a "knowledge base" or "second brain" 
    application, specifically targetted at creative authors and Game 
    Masters of fantasy games who conjure up their own worlds and need a 
    good tool to keep track of it all. Few applications on the market 
    suffice for this very niche task, but it's a niche that 
    <a href="https://github.com/igrad/Calliope">Calliope</a> aims to fill.

<h1>Programming</h1>

<p>
    My primary focus is on object-oriented programming via imperative 
    (namely C-based) languages such as C++. I also have a good amount of 
    experience with other paradigms, including front-end web development 
    and functional programming. I've written a substantial amount of code 
    in Python and Powershell for systems scripting (still learning my way 
    through bash). Currently I'm using C++14 and Python the most.
</p>

<p>
    Most of my programming knowledge has been self-taught; I've 
    found that no one seems to teach in the way that I learn best - highly 
    visual examples and guided practice. Data structures, object-oriented 
    paradigms, even code styling practices were all learned as a result of 
    my own curiosity. As a result, I'm still very flexible in my coding 
    practice. When I learn something new, I'm eager to implement it in 
    some way that fits in my current project, though that has put me in a 
    few pinches in the past - sometimes the new tool isn't the right one 
    for the job.

<h3>Current Project: Catacombs of Halfwind Keep</h3>
<p>
    If you've never played <a href="https://www.nethack.org/">NetHack</a>, you're missing out on an experience that is essential to understanding how much video games (and computers) have evolved since their introduction to the mass market. NetHack is what the cutting edge of the video game world used to look like, as Rogue and NetHack were among the first games with graphics. It's fantastically fun, and equally frustrating. There is A LOT to learn about the game, with odd keybindings, no tutorial, and merciless AI. It's a pretty faithful recreation of early Dungeons & Dragons: you're slapped into a dungeon with little context, you can interact with most everything you find in some way (often in ways more creative than you may initially think), and you aren't expected to survive.
</p>
<p>
    Fast forward almost 35 years (NetHack was released in 1985!) and now almost every game has a multiplayer aspect - and for good reason. Multiplayer is a whole new layer of interaction with a game, and it manifests in many different ways. One of my favorite multiplayer systems is what you see in Minecraft. Players can fight against each other, work cooperatively, or function independently and sparsely interact. That freedom of choice is a game mechanic in itself, and one that I want Catacombs of Halfwind Keep to revolve around. As Adam Millard eloquently put it in his <a
    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39DqD38J-l0">YouTube video</a> about the changes we've seen in multiplayer games over the years:
</p>
<p>
    <div class="big_quote">
    "Playing a game with other people doesn't make it more fun -<br />
    what does, is <span style="font-style: normal;">interacting</span> with them."
    </div>
</p>
<p>
    Catacombs of Halfwind Keep aims to bring the grind, nuance, and vastness of NetHack into the 21st century by taking the same premise and expanding it through graphics, character customization and growth, exploration, and multiplayer interaction. Where NetHack is very clunky, CHK aims to be more discrete and allow players to have more refined control over their inevitable death. It draws heavily from Dungeons and Dragons and NetHack's original vision, but I also want to ensure that it becomes its own beast and not a clone.
