            Hey! I'm Ian. I'm an Iowan programmer with an ambition for software design and user interface. I recently graduated from the University of Iowa with a B.S. in Computer Science, and I'm looking for employment in the Midwest.

      <p>This page is a small hub for everything you need to know about me, but if you have any questions for me (professional or otherwise), please feel free to send me an email at <a href="mailto:iangradert@gmail.com">iangradert@gmail.com</a>.</p>
            
      <p>Outside of programming, I'm a huge fan of video games. Looter-shooters and RPGs have come to be some of my favorite genres, but I've dabbled in every genre available. In fact, video games are what got me into programming in the first place. I started modding Call of Duty 2 back in 2006, and continued into modding Call of Duty 4 when it released in 2007. I made custom maps, custom level and action scripts, and even modded some of the weapons' properties (such as making an MP40 behave more like a mini-uzi). From there, I modded Valve games, and eventually got into more serious programming in college through the engineering track. Now I'm proficient in a half-dozen languages and frameworks, and I'm even building a video game of my own. I'm also still growing as a programmer and software developer - learning new tricks, refining my style, and adopting new
      practices.</p>
      
      <p>I greatly enjoy various forms of media; jazz and metal, shooter games and puzzle games, YouTube skits, 70s/80s cinema, and more. I'm more creative than many of the other tech people I've met, which lends itself toward designing solutions and drafting up ideas. I'm also slowly becoming a table-top gaming nerd, though I don't have the collection or aggregate play-time to call myself one quite yet. As fond as I am of Dungeons & Dragons, my group plays once per month at its most frequent.</p>
         
      <p>I currently have one project in active development, and several others on the sketchboard, along with a plethora of other ideas that will likely never come to fruition. The current project is a 2D game inspired by the likes of the old DOS games NetHack and Rogue, and draws heavily on fantasy elements from Dungeons & Dragons and Lord of the Rings. It's envisioned to be a cooperative, multi-player experience of diving into dungeons and caves, fighting off monsters and baddies, and finding cool loot along the way to make your character stronger the deeper you go. Currently, it's titled Catacombs of Halfwind Keep. You can find more information about it in the projects section.</p>

      <h1>Programming</h1>

      <p>
         My primary focus is on object-oriented programming via imperative (namely C-based) languages such as C++, C#, C, and some Java when I need it for projects. I also have a good amount of experience with other paradigms, including web programming in raw HTML/CSS, JavaScript with JQuery and AJAX for remote calls. I've also written a substantial amount of code in Python and Powershell, and I've dabbled in Haskell as far as functional languages are concerned. I've also done a small amount of work in Prolog, Agda, and MATLAB, but those were so long ago that I would need a serious refresher before I could consider myself "knowledgable" with them. I also pride myself on being able to read unfamiliar languages through "intent", meaning I can infer the use of a function through naming and comments, and bumble my way through the code one chunk at a time to get a sense for what exactly is going on. I've used this in the past to read some Ruby-on-Rails, R, and Scala.
      </p>

      <p>
         Most of my programming knowledge has been self-taught because I've found that no one seems to teach in the way that I learn best - highly visual examples and guided practice examples. Data structures, object-oriented paradigms, even code styling practices were all learned as a result of my own curiosity. As a result, I'm still very flexible in my coding practice. When I learn something new, I'm eager to implement it in some way that fits in my current project, though that has put me in a few pinches in the past.
      </p>

      <p>
         As a result of my young age and limited experience with any one specific technology in the IT industry, I have yet to develop a proper specialization. Most everyone in 2019 was talking about AI and machine learning, and while I understand the practice and its vulnerabilities, I'm too keen on keeping my options open before sinking my teeth deep into one particular thing.

      <h3>Current Project: Catacombs of Halfwind Keep</h3>
      <p>
         If you've never played <a href="https://www.nethack.org/">NetHack</a>, you're missing out on an experience that is
         essential to understanding how much video games (and computers) have evolved since their introduction to the mass
         market. NetHack is what the cutting edge of the video game world used to look like, as Rogue and NetHack were among
         the first games with graphics. It's fantastically fun, and equally frustrating. There is A LOT to learn about the
         game, with odd keybindings, no tutorial, and merciless AI. It's a pretty faithful recreation of early Dungeons &
         Dragons: you're slapped into a dungeon with little context, you can interact with most everything you find in some
         way (often in ways more creative than you may initially think), and you aren't expected to survive.
      </p>
      <p>
         Fast forward almost 35 years (NetHack was released in 1985!) and now almost every game has a multiplayer aspect - and
         for good reason. Multiplayer is a whole new layer of interaction with a game, and it manifests in many different
         ways. One of my favorite multiplayer systems is what you see in Minecraft. Players can fight against each other, work
         cooperatively, or function independently and sparsely interact. That freedom of choice is a game mechanic in itself,
         and one that I want Catacombs of Halfwind Keep to revolve around. As Adam Millard eloquently put it in his <a
            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39DqD38J-l0">YouTube video</a> about the changes we've seen in multiplayer
         games over the years:
      </p>
      <p>
         <div class="big_quote">
            "Playing a game with other people doesn't make it more fun -<br />
            what does, is <span style="font-style: normal;">interacting</span> with them."
         </div>
      </p>
      <p>
         Catacombs of Halfwind Keep aims to bring the grind, nuance, and vastness of NetHack into the 21st century by taking
         the same premise and expanding it through graphics, character customization and growth, exploration, and multiplayer
         interaction. Where NetHack is very clunky, CHK aims to be more discrete and allow players to have more refined
         control over their inevitable death. It draws heavily from Dungeons and Dragons and NetHack's original vision, but I
         also want to ensure that it becomes its own beast and not a clone.
      </p>
