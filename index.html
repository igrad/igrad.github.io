            <p>Hi, I'm Ian. I'm an Iowan programmer with an ambition for software design and user interface. I'm currently finishing out my B.S. degree in Computer Science at the University of Iowa, and I'm looking for employment in the Midwest shortly after graduating in December of 2019.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>This page is a small hub for everything you need to know about me, but if you have any questions for me (professional or otherwise), please feel free to send me an email at <a href="mailto:iangradert@gmail.com">iangradert@gmail.com</a>.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>I greatly enjoy various forms of media; jazz and metal, shooter games and puzzle games, YouTube skits, 70s/80s cinema, and more. I have monthly features talking about my top picks for games and music. These posts detail why I'm enjoying that particular work and why you should, too. I'm also still growing as a programmer and software developer - learning new tricks, refining my style, and adopting new practices.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>I currently have one project in active development, and several others on the sketchboard, along with a plethora of other ideas that will likely never come to fruition. The current project is a 2D game inspired by the likes of the old DOS games NetHack and Rogue, and draws heavily on fantasy elements from Dungeons & Dragons and Lord of the Rings. It's envisioned to be a cooperative, multi-player experience of diving into dungeons and caves, fighting off monsters and baddies, and finding cool loot along the way to make your character stronger the deeper you go. Currently, it's titled Catacombs of Halfwind Keep. You can find more information about it in the projects section.</p>

                        A multiplayer rogue-like inspired by NetHack and Dungeons & Dragons.

                           If you've never played <a href="https://www.nethack.org/">NetHack</a>, you're missing out on an experience that is essential to understanding how much video games (and computers) have evolved since their introduction to the mass market. NetHack is what the cutting edge of the video game world used to look like, as Rogue and NetHack were among the first games with graphics. It's fantastically fun, and equally frustrating. There is A LOT to learn about the game, with odd keybindings, no tutorial, and merciless AI. It's a pretty faithful recreation of early Dungeons & Dragons: you're slapped into a dungeon with little context, you can interact with most everything you find in some way (often in ways more creative than you may initially think), and you aren't expected to survive.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           Fast forward almost 35 years (NetHack was released in 1985!) and now almost every game has a multiplayer aspect - and for good reason. Multiplayer is a whole new layer of interaction with a game, and it manifests in many different ways. One of my favorite multiplayer systems is what you see in Minecraft. Players can fight against each other, work cooperatively, or function independently and sparsely interact. That freedom of choice is a game mechanic in itself, and one that I want CHK to revolve around. As Adam Millard eloquently put it in his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39DqD38J-l0">YouTube video</a> about the changes we've seen in multiplayer games over the years:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <div class="big_quote">
                              "Playing a game with other people doesn't make it more fun -<br/>
                              what does, is <span style="font-style: normal;">interacting</span> with them."
                           </div>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           Catacombs of Halfwind Keep aims to bring the grind, nuance, and vastness of NetHack into the 21st century by taking the same premise as NetHack and expanding it. Where NetHack is very chunky, CHK is more discrete, which allows players to have more refined control over their inevitable death.

                        The adventure of a boy who survived the zombie
                        apocalype, and must find his way home.

                           I've had this idea for a video game for at least four or five years. It follows the story of a young boy who by no small miracle survived a sudden zombie apocalype that took the world by storm in a matter of hours. Scared and alone, he must make his way through a relentless city occupied by zombies, scavengers, and what little law enforcement remains.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           This is a very ambitious project, and it's a story that I want to tell right. It's something I can see myself working on for years, and it shouldn't be my first indie game. Thus, this project is on hold while Catacombs of Halfwind Keep is still under development. There is only concept writing for this game in place so far, not much to show.

                           Like Rodney, this is another game I should very much like to develop, but it's a story that I want to tell correctly. As such, this is planned to be my next project after Catacombs of Halfwind Keep and Rodney.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           The idea of playing with color as a game mechanic has been stuck in my head for a long time, but the story and mechanics to accompany it have eluded me until recently. Guy is a story of a man who had abandoned all emotion in life in place of just trying to get by with a 9 to 5 - the kind of person who has been worked and abused for so long that they no longer see good in the world. This story begins as he finds love, and starts to see the bright side of things again. The story board on this short, experimental game is still very much in development, so there isn't much to show for this yet.

                           Any Dungeons & Dragons dungeon master (DM/GM) worth their salt can attest to the difficulties in keeping track of the world brewed in only their mind. Recalling names of places, interactions with people, and how many times the players have been arrested is tricky business, and there aren't many tools out there designed to assist in this intimidating task. Queue GM World Notes, a desktop tool designed with Game Masters in mind to keep all of the notes one could ever need all in a single, neatly-organized place.

                        <p>
                           GM World Notes allows for the user to create their own organizational system, but relies on the folder/file paradigm that everyone is already familiar with. Store templates for certain page types. Tag pages for quick catagorization. Search through all page titles, contents, tags, or everything. Every pixel is designed to help you be the best GM you can be, because it's made by a GM with terrible long term memory.
