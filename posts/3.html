         If you've never heard Tool, I can only describe them as the Pink Floyd of progressive metal insofar as they don't follow the mold of other bands in their genre. Their music is strange, explorative, and inquisitive. Many of their lyrics and songs deal with religion, social norms, even abnormal mathematical patterns. On top of all that, the music itself (especially guitars) is absolutely killer. Schism in particular of mine since it uses 5/4 time signature, which gives it an odd candence that still flows just as well as a 3/4 or 4/4 tune.

         Tool recently put their entire discography on Spotify, which is something their fanbase has desired for years. One or more band members have voiced a strong moral opposition to music streaming services like Spotify, or any other digital service like iTunes. I've heard over the years that their albums are meant to be experienced hand-on (literally), and should be experienced in the album's entirety from beginning to end in-order. For any other band, this would be seen as pompous and self-righteous, but Tool's international repute have given them space to pull it off.

         Among other great tracks from Tool are:
         <ul>
            <li>"Ã†nima"</li>
            <li>"Lateralus" (which features repeating time signatures coinciding with the Fibonacci sequence (it's something else))</li>
            <li>"The Pot" (another one of their super-popular songs, even among less die-hard fans)</li>
            <li>"Parabol"</li>
         </ul>
