         I've been in love with this track since I found it back in 2017. It's an electronic tune, but with sporadic, subtle hints of jazz influence and swing notes, which give it a distinct attitude. It's the track I think of when picking songs for my "Jazztronica" playlist. One subtle catch you might hear at the start is a car door opening just before the calmly-monotonous car door open sound, the one sound which persists through nearly the song's entirety.

         Tennyson have several tracks of similar quality, though few of similar tempo and attitude. Lay-by is by far their most popular track, as it has been featured on one or two of Spotify's playlists I've seen. Many of their other tracks are less emotionally-intense, or perhaps less somber. Many of their tracks also feature guest vocalists. They also have a good collection of remixes on their Spotify profile.
