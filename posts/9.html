         "You could probably find a job anywhere - everyone needs a tech guy!", say the relatives who don't know the difference between software development and infrastructure maintenance.
      </p>
      <p>
         I've gone through job hunts before, but I was fortunate enough to land local jobs at great companies after just a handful of applications. Granted, those were temporary summer gigs originally, but the hunt for full-time employment in a software development (or related) position is proving lengthy. I've been applying to different locations across the Midwest since early October, and even landed a few interviews, but was then promptly ghosted.
      </p>
      <p>
         There's something unique I've come to find about employment websites like Indeed, Handshake, etc. Only tech recruiters put out positions with "Junior" titles. There are a handful of firms that have "Early Career" positions listed, but not many. Most every other position of the sort has several years-worth of experience as a requirement, or requires experience with some niche framework. 
      </p>
      <p>
         One of the biggest issues with this field at the moment is that, ever   since the internet boom came about and magnitudes of people began entering the industry, every generation of programmer has felt the need to reinvent the wheel and create some brand-new framework instead of improving upon existing frameworks. These new technologies start out as very niche, and then expand because "we like the syntax" or because "it's better than other language X". To think, Java was started so that small applications could run cross-platform and communicate across devices, and now it's being used for something as response-time intensive as video games, and even has a server framework in JSP. Compare that to C++ where compiling down to assembly is significantly faster (and easier on the machine) to run rather than interpreting bytecode through the JVM, but everyone seems to love the overburdened syntax of Java for whatever reason.
      </p>
      <p>
         So now we have dozens of server frameworks, dozens of front-end frameworks, thousands of libraries, and no small number of languages themselves, all of which have been expanded beyond their original scope, save perhaps ultra-niche languages like MATLAB, Prolog, and R.
      </p>
      <p>
         How is an entry-level developer supposed to know all of these things or have experience with them? Well, the one thing I've learned throughout this process is that <italic>you aren't expected to know them.</italic> If you do know them, it's a huge gold star on your application to the position since it requires less training, but it's no guarantee. No one realistically expects a recent college grad to know JSE, Spring, JQuery, and Angular while you're still green. What they <italic>do</italic> expect, however, is that you're willing and able to learn them, and preferably to do so quickly. An interesting point to note: if you want to make it in a field that evolves as rapidly as technology, you absolutely need to be a fast learner, or you'll get left behind and find yourself using 30-year-old technology. It's a steep learning curve for beginners, but it never plateaus, which keeps the senior-level folks on their toes as well.
      </p>
      <p>
         So, if you're a fresh-grad like myself, the best advice you can get is to <italic>familiarize</italic> yourself with all of these frameworks, just so you can at least say "yeah, I've heard of it" and vaguely understand what the prospective company's setup looks like. Outside of that, just keep busting your butt to learn and improve as fast as you can, and keep your eyes peeled for job openings.
