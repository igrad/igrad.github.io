         Central Iowa has been fortunate to have its very own jazz station based in Cedar Rapids. I started my deep-dive into the jazz world in Autumn 2018, and quickly found 88.3 KCCK to sate that newfound appetite. Among the bounty of tunes I've picked up from the station's remarkably diverse rotation, by far my favorite discovery has been "Pirate Song".

         Vanderheyden's album "Complete Life" was featured as KCCK's album of the month way back in August of 2009, and he's been in their repertoire since then. I've made a fool of myself by not listening to more of his music - not for lack of interest, more likely a lack of time.

         This tune itself is hard to describe for an amateur enthusiast such as myself. I have a lack of words for how fluid and enigmatic it sounds. There's something of a classical vibe to it, but it's remarkably subtle since the droning of more modern effects often covers up the subtle hints of smooth jazz. The energy and impetus that Joel captures in the second half of this tune is honestly astounding. Like a great story, it hooks you in, builds tension and suspense, and then releases into a euphoria of gentle percussion and mellow tones.

         If you're into jazz, do yourself a favor and check this guy out.
