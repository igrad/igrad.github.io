			It's been a gloomy November. Snow landed before half of the leaves did. If there was ever a jazz album to play to celebrate the impending dread of winter, it's Miles Davis's "Kind of Blue".
		</p>
		<p>
			The album itself is legendary among jazz enthusiasts. Miles lived his life at the frontlines of jazz's constant evolution. He spearheaded the movement into cool jazz (namely with "Kind of Blue"), was a frontrunner with Coltrane and Gordon into Bebop, and was one of the most recognized fusion jazz artists after rock made its big break (we don't talk about avant-garde here).
		</p>

			I had a hard time falling in love with jazz. I'm a fairly orderly and proper person overall, so swing notes, asyncopation, and flairs took a little while to warm up to. "Blue in Green" was one of the songs that helped to ease that transition. It's mellow, yet clear. It's subtle, yet substantial. It's calming, yet contemplative. It's everything you want in a great jazz tune. There's a small handful of songs that I turn to when trying to re-approach a programming issue that I've been staring at for far too long with no progress, and this song tops that list.
